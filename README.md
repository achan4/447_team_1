CMSC447 semester project
## How to Run the Web Application

1. Install Python 3.6+ and PIP
2. Install virtualenv [Here](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)
3. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, run the command, `python -m venv venv` to create the virtual environment. This virtual environment should be created in the root folder, "447_team_1". To activate the virtual environment, run the command `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (if you are on windows, for mac or linux it may be different).
4. Install all required packages in the virtual environment. All packages and their versions are saved in the file "requirements.txt". To install these packages, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. To start the web application, the "app.py" file is ran, and the application opens on `http://localhost:5000`. To run the application, make sure you are in the root folder, "447_team_1", and inside the virtual environment. Then, in the command prompt type `python app.py`. The application should be opened in your browser.
